# single cell RNA-seq initial processing pipeline
* author Jonatan Thompson, Pers Lab, rkm916@ku.dk

v0.2 12-11-2018
### Added 
* Specify names of samples to align or merge
* Filter on nGene or nUMI and specify prop.mito and prop.ribo
* Plot Malat1 by default as a useful marker for intact neuronal cells

### Fixed
* alignment with 2 group_IDs: mistakenly called RunCCA rather than multiCCA even if number of objects within groups could exceed 2.
* brackets mean that RunPCA and RunTSNE were selecting half or a third of desired parameters, e..g half of p_comp.
* Set check_duplicated =F in RunTSNE to avoid error due to identical cells
* added safeParallel to prevent parallel-related errors
* make sure cell names are unique between sets before merging or aligning
* check length of list_seurat_obj before mergin or aligning
* changed label for fake cells in doubletFinder from 'X' to avoid confusion with cellnames that have X in them

### changed
* rewrite flow of merge logic to reduce repetition and correct errors
* rewrite flow of align logic to reduce repetition and correct errors
* changed doubletFinder to label outliers rather than fixed number of cells as outliers
